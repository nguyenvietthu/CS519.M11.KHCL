- This technique allows you to understand a situation, to discern a problem by analysing all the aspects. As outlined by Jean-Pierre Giraud, on the blog The big sales techniques : “The 5W1H method allows you to discern the information needed to better understand, encompass, clarify, structure, frame a situation; as this way of thinking allows you to explore all the dimensions from different perspectives”.

- This tool is very popular amongst journalists whilst also being used and applied to different contexts. It will help you ask the right questions, expand your enquiry and obtain the right information, which in turn helps you find the best solutions.
