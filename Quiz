Q4.1. What is 5w1h?:
- Otherwise known as the questioning method or the method of the Five Ws, 5W1H is an acronym in which every letter corresponds to a question: what, who, where, when, how and Why.

- This technique allows you to understand a situation, to discern a problem by analysing all the aspects. As outlined by Jean-Pierre Giraud, on the blog The big sales techniques : “The 5W1H method allows you to discern the information needed to better understand, encompass, clarify, structure, frame a situation; as this way of thinking allows you to explore all the dimensions from different perspectives”.

- This tool is very popular amongst journalists whilst also being used and applied to different contexts. It will help you ask the right questions, expand your enquiry and obtain the right information, which in turn helps you find the best solutions. This method allows you to guide all your team members and to gather all the factual elements needed for a complete and objective understanding.

Example: When you DEFINE YOUR PROJECT
=>This questioning method is a useful tool to define all the aspects of a project before starting.

What?: What is the project? What are the objectives?
Who?: Who is the client? Who are the users? Who are the members of the team ?
Where?: Where will the project take place?
When?: What is the date of the consignment? When will it start? How long will it last?
How:? Which financial, HR and technical means have been put in place to create the project? By what means will you progress?
How many?: What budget do you have at your disposal? What are the delays in the realisation?
Why: Why has the project been started? What are the reasons? What is the goal?
